## Customer Meeting 1
#### 10th of October 2022: 3.00-3.45pm
##### MS Teams - Aidan Dow, Derek Somerville, Tim Storer, Mereilla Bikanga Ada

* Tim reveals that he would like to use the application to monitor the L3 Team projects.
* Mereilla would use the application for the MSci Projects.

## Tims Vision
* Tim is less interested in fancy graphs, he wants to see lots of different metrics. 
* He doesn't really know which metrics are important, so would like to be able to see many.
* Ability to have developers in groups, and possibly subgroups of these developers.
* Dashboard, as shown in /repo-monitor/research/repo-monitor.png
* Dashboard would consist of a grid of squares, each square corresponding to a team. 
* Each square would show a number, corresponding to a metric (i.e. number of commits for last 2 weeks.)
* This metric could be changed, and the grid updated to reflect the new values.
* The squares could show a colour gradient, with green for good metric values, red for poorer.
* Ability to filter/sort in various ways
* Possibly sidebar, with tree structure of Group -> Subgroup -> Developers | Projects
* Information doesn't need to be time accurate, could be accurate to yesterday at worst.
* Different metrics could be Open Pull requests / Closed / Issues / Wiki Changes / Commits etc.
* One whole metric, activity points = sum of all metrics.


* Tim and Derek Recommended I use people doing ASEP to do an evaluation. Possibly use focus groups.
