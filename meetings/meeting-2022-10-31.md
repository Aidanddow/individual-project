## Third Supervisory Meeting Minutes - Week 4
#### 24th of October 2022: 1.15-1.45pm
##### MS Teams - Aidan Dow, Derek Somerville

* I hadn't really made much progress this week
* I showed progress on the application (Fixed a few bugs etc)
* I explained that I think the scope of the project has changed a lot, and am very unsure as to what sort of papers I should be reading up on to research the project.
* Derek suggested that I could do anything. He recommended I just choose something to research, which is slightly relevant, but most importantly, that I am interested in.
* I said that I am actually interested in judging progress on a project, and think I will focus on that.
* Derek reminded me that there is an old project, which I can compare my new project with, that can be a significant portion of my dissertation.
* Derek, for a suggestion suggested I could research the performance differences of caching data in the frontend vs loading it from the backend
* Another suggestion was to investigate the enviromental (CO2) impact of my application.
