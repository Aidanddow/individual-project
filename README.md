This is the repository for my Honours Project, Repo-Monitor. Repo-Monitor is a web-application intended to make it easy to monitor progress across several software repositories at the same time.

### Project Structure
* `repo-monitor` contains the source code for the project, with a README detailing run instructions
* `research` contains notebooks and files which were used to research the project
* `dissertation` contains the files for the dissertation
* `meetings` contains minutes from supervisor meetings
* `timelog.md` is a file showing the time spent on the project
